# Privacy Policy for Daily Life Toolkit

Last updated: January 31, 2026

Daily Life Toolkit ("we", "us", or "our") operates the Daily Life Toolkit mobile application (the "App"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our App.

### 1. Information Collection and Use

Our App is designed to prioritize your privacy. We focus on **offline-first** functionality and local data storage.

- **Camera Permission**: This App requires access to your device's camera to enable the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for text extraction and QR code scanning features. Images captured are processed locally and are not transmitted to any external servers.
- **Contacts Permission**: If you use the Emergency Info or Expense Splitter modules, you may choose to import contacts. This data remains on your device and is used only within the App.
- **Notification Permission**: The App uses notifications to provide timely reminders for warranties, medications, or budget alerts. These are managed locally on your device.
- **Storage Access**: The App requires access to your device's storage to save exported reports (PDF, CSV, TXT) and backups.
- **In-App Purchases**: We use Google Play's billing system for Pro features. Transaction data is managed by Google.

### 2. Data Storage

All financial data, budget details, and personal notes created within the App are stored **locally on your device**. We do not have access to your private data.

### 3. Third-Party Services

We use Google ML Kit for on-device processing. We also use In-App Purchases which may collect data according to Google's Privacy Policy.

### 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
